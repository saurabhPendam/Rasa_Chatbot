  utter_mental_illness:
  - text:  "Mental illnesses are health conditions that disrupt a person's thoughts, emotions, relationships, and daily functioning. They are associated with distress and diminished capacity to engage in the ordinary activities of daily life. Mental illnesses fall along a continuum of severity: some are fairly mild and only interfere with some aspects of life, such as certain phobias. On the other end of the spectrum lie serious mental illnesses, which result in major functional impairment and interference with daily life. These include such disorders as major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, and may require that the person receives care in a hospital. It is important to know that mental illnesses are medical conditions that have nothing to do with a person's character, intelligence, or willpower. Just as diabetes is a disorder of the pancreas, mental illness is a medical condition due to the brain's biology. Similarly to how one would treat diabetes with medication and insulin, mental illness is treatable with a combination of medication and social support. These treatments are highly effective, with 70-90 percent of individuals receiving treatment experiencing a reduction in symptoms and an improved quality of life. With the proper treatment, it is very possible for a person with mental illness to be independent and successful.\n

  utter_mental_illness_affect:
  - text: "It is estimated that mental illness affects 1 in 5 adults in India, and that 1 in 24 adults have a serious mental illness. Mental illness does not discriminate; it can affect anyone, regardless of gender, age, income, social status, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or background. Although mental illness can affect anyone, certain conditions may be more common in different populations. For instance, eating disorders tend to occur more often in females, while disorders such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder is more prevalent in children. Additionally, all ages are susceptible, but the young and the old are especially vulnerable. Mental illnesses usually strike individuals in the prime of their lives, with 75 percent of mental health conditions developing by the age of 24. This makes identification and treatment of mental disorders particularly difficult, because the normal personality and behavioral changes of adolescence may mask symptoms of a mental health condition. Parents and caretakers should be aware of this fact, and take notice of changes in their child√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢s mood, personality, personal habits, and social withdrawal. When these occur in children under 18, they are referred to as serious emotional disturbances (SEDs)."
  - text: "Mental illness does can affect anyone, regardless of gender, age, income, social status, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or background."

  utter_causes_mental_illness:
  - text: "Mental illness can affect how you cope at work, how you function in relationships and your ability to manage everyday tasks. It can also impact how you think, feel and behave. Examples of mental illness include depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders and addictive behaviors. Sometimes symptoms of a mental health disorder appear as physical problems, such as stomach pain, back pain, headaches, or other unexplained aches and pains. If you have any signs or symptoms of a mental illness, see your primary care provider or a mental health professional. Most mental illnesses don't improve on their own, and if untreated, a mental illness may get worse over time and cause serious problems."

  utter_sign_mental_illness:
  - text: "The causes of mental illness are complex and multifaceted, often involving a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors. Genetic predisposition plays a significant role, as individuals with a family history of mental disorders are at a higher risk of developing one themselves. Environmental factors, such as early life experiences, trauma, chronic stress, and substance abuse, can also contribute to the onset of mental illnesses. Additionally, imbalances in brain chemistry and structure can be influential, leading to conditions like depression, anxiety, or schizophrenia. Moreover, societal and cultural factors, such as stigma and access to mental healthcare, can impact the development and course of mental disorders. It's important to understand that mental illness is a complex interplay of these factors, and the specific causes can vary widely from one individual to another. Effective prevention, treatment, and support often involve a holistic approach that addresses these various factors."
  - text: "Symptoms of mental health disorders vary depending on the type and severity of the condition."

  utter_mental_illness_recover:
  - text: "When healing from mental illness, early identification and treatment are of vital importance. Based on the nature of the illness, there are a range of effective treatments available. For any type of treatment, it is essential that the person affected is proactive and fully engaged in their own recovery process. Many people with mental illnesses who are diagnosed and treated respond well, although some might experience a return of symptoms. Even in such cases, with careful monitoring and management of the disorder, it is still quite possible to live a fulfilled and productive life."

  utter_mental_illness_symptoms:
  - text: "Although Pandora cannot substitute for professional advice, we encourage those with symptoms to talk to their friends and family members and seek the counsel of a mental health professional. The sooner the mental health condition is identified and treated, the sooner they can get on the path to recovery. If you know someone who is having problems, don't assume that the issue will resolve itself. Let them know that you care about them, and that there are treatment options available that will help them heal. Speak with a mental health professional or counselor if you think your friend or family member is experiencing the symptoms of a mental health condition. If the affected loved one knows that you support them, they will be more likely to seek out help."

  utter_mental_health_involved:

Some questions you will need to have answered include:\n What is known about the cause of this particular illness?\n Are there other diagnoses where these symptoms are common?\n Do you normally include a physical or neurological examination?\n Are there any additional tests or exams that you would recommend at this point?\n Would you advise an independent opinion from another psychiatrist at this point?\n What program of treatment is the most helpful with this diagnosis?\n Will this program involve services by other specialists? If so, who will be responsible for coordinating these services?\n What do you see as the family's role in this program of treatment?\n How much access will the family have to the individuals who are providing the treatment?\n What medications are generally used with this diagnosis?\n How much experience do you have in treating individuals with this illness?\n What can I do to help you in the treatment?"

Support groups are offered by community organizations, mental health service providers, schools, campuses, and support agencies. Here are some general resources to help you find a mental health or substance use related support group in BC: Talk to your mental health care provider. They might be able to make recommendations. The Mood Disorders Association of BC offers a network of peer support groups around the province for people who experience mental illnesses like mood disorders or post-traumatic stress disorder. They also have groups for family and friends. Groups are drop-in. Many Canadian Mental Health Association branches offer support services, including support groups. If your local branch doesn‚Äôt have their own program, they can recommend other services in your community. The BC Schizophrenia Society maintains a directory of support groups and other regular events for family members of people with a mental illness. For groups related to alcohol or drug use, call the Alcohol and Drug Information Referral Service at 1-800-663-1441 or 604-660-9382 in the Lower Mainland. For groups in the Lower Mainland, search the Red Book Online. If you are at school or on campus, talk to a school counsellor or your campus‚Äô health and wellness office. For online support, see some suggestions at www.heretohelp.bc.ca/discuss. This can be particularly useful if you don‚Äôt have a group in your community or have trouble getting to an in-person group. In order to benefit the most from a support group, you need to feel safe enough to share your experiences and thoughts, and you need to feel comfortable supporting others. It can be helpful to contact the group facilitator or organizer ahead of time to see if a particular group might be a good fit for you. We have a checklist to help you evaluate support groups‚Äîincluding when it might be time to leave one. Sometimes a group just doesn‚Äôt work for you, and that‚Äôs okay.

For example, you might prefer a video chat over a phone call, or you might prefer to text throughout the day rather than one set time for a video call. Then, work with your social networks to make a plan. You might video chat with your close friends in the evening and phone a family member once a week. Remember to be mindful of people who may not be online. Check in by phone and ask how you can help. The quality of your social connections matter. Mindlessly scrolling through social media and liking a few posts usually doesn't build strong social connections. Make sure you focus on strategies that actually make you feel included and connected. If your current strategies don't help you feel connected, problem-solve to see if you can find a solution. Everyone feels lonely at times. Maybe you recently moved to a new city, are changing your circle of friends, lost someone important in your life, or lost your job and also lost important social connections with coworkers. Other people may have physical connections to others but may feel like their emotional or social needs aren't met. Measures like social distancing or self-isolation can make loneliness feel worse no matter why you feel lonely now. Reach out to the connections you do have. Suggest ways to keep in touch and see if you can set a regular time to connect. People may hesitate to reach out for a lot of different reasons, so don't be afraid to be the one who asks. Look for local community support groups and mutual aid groups on social media. This pandemic is bringing everyone together, so look for opportunities to make new connections. These groups are a great way to share your skills and abilities or seek help and support. Look for specialized support groups. Support groups are moving online, and there are a lot of different support lines to call if you need to talk to someone."

  utter_anxiety_stress:

Stress is related to the same fight, flight, or freeze response as anxiety, and the physical sensations of anxiety and stress may be very similar. The cause of stress and anxiety are usually different, however. Stress focuses on mainly external pressures on us that we're finding hard to cope with. When we are stressed, we usually know what we're stressed about, and the symptoms of stress typically disappear after the stressful situation is over. Anxiety, on the other hand, isn't always as easy to figure out. Anxiety focuses on worries or fears about things that could threaten us, as well as anxiety about the anxiety itself. Stress and anxiety are both part of being human, but both can be problems if they last for a long time or have an impact on our well-being or daily life."

In these cases, feelings of sadness go away quickly and you can go about your daily life. Other ways to talk about sadness might be feeling low, feeling down, or feeling blue.A person may say they are feeling depressed, but if it goes away on its own and doesn't impact life in a big way, it probably isn't the illness of depression. Depression is a mental illness that affects your mood, the way you understand yourself, and the way you understand and relate to things around you. It can also go by different names, such as clinical depression, major depressive disorder, or major depression. Depression can come up for no reason, and it lasts for a long time. It's much more than sadness or low mood. People who experience depression may feel worthless or hopeless. They may feel unreasonable guilty. Some people may experience depression as anger or irritability. It may be hard to concentrate or make decisions. Most people lose interest in things that they used to enjoy and may isolate themselves from others. There are also physical signs of depression, such as problems with sleep, appetite and energy and unexplainable aches or pains. Some may experience difficult thoughts about death or ending their life (suicide). Depression lasts longer than two weeks, doesn't usually go away on its own, and impacts your life. It's a real illness, and it is very treatable. It's important to seek help if you're concerned about depression."

We all have to step up during a pandemic because we all have a part to play in reducing the spread of the virus. It's important that you know what must be done and how you should do it. This is important for the health of your neighbours and your own mental health, and taking action can help counter difficult feelings like hopelessness and despair. One study from people in China found that people who had reliable up-to-date information about the coronavirus and COVID-19 illness and accurate instructions on how they should act (such as instructions around hand-washing and wearing a mask) felt more resilient and felt better able to handle the virus. People who received good, accurate information reported lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. This research is available for free at www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/5/1729. Of course, it's okay to set limits. Staying informed does not mean that you have to follow the news all day. Check in a few times a day, sticking to trusted sources and media outlets. While social media can be a great way to keep in touch with family and friends, social media can also amplify bad advice, vague or untrue stories, and other unhelpful information.

It's so easy to spread information online, and we can't assume that the source we're reading or watching is the original source. Before you can evaluate anything, you need to know where the claims come from and determine if it's a reliable source. Reliable sources on the coronavirus and COVID-19 illness include the World Health Organization (WHO), Government of Canada ministries and agencies like Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada, the Government of BC ministries and agencies like the BC Ministry of Health, and the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC). Scientists and researchers at universities and other institutions and health sciences professionals are also important sources of information. Headlines and titles need to be simple and short, so they can sometimes be misleading on their own. They may also be purposefully shocking or controversial to entice you to click to read more. Websites that belong to governments, government-funded agencies, well-known health providers, universities, or groups of medical professionals are generally the most reliable. Be careful of sites that don't list the author or don't tell you much about themselves.

What you can do is make a plan and decide how you'll manage the things you do control, like your ability to stay safe, follow public health measures, stay connected with loved ones, and take care of your mental and physical health. Events like a pandemic change a lot over time, and that uncertainty can add to fear and stress. The truth is that we don't know what will happen next‚Äîbut that doesn't mean we're all helpless. You can do a lot. You can: Map out a daily schedule, including times you can connect with loved ones online or by phone Plan out daily tasks and goals Give yourself a schedule to look up current information Make sure you have 14 days of healthy food and household supplies at home Keep medications on hand and talk to your doctor for advice if you're at increased risk Educate yourself on public health measures and figure out how you'll follow those instructions Figure out how you'll manage increased childcare demands, working for home, or other changes to your usual routine Determine if you'll need financial supports like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit or BC Temporary Rent Supplement if your job is affected by COVID-19. If you anticipate a need, you can find application instructions and gather any documents or other pieces of information ahead of time Figure out how you'll manage times when you feel overwhelmed or hopeless, like calming activities, the number for a local support or crisis line, a video chat with a loved one, or a way to connect with your mental health care provider Look for local support organizations, neighbourhood groups, or mutual aid groups if you need extra help or support or would like to help others in your community Some planning will be straightforward, but you may also encounter situations or times when it's harder to see a solution or good plan of action. This is a great time to practice problem-solving skills. Problem-solving is a method that helps you break down a complicated situation into manageable pieces, look for realistic and unbiased information, brainstorm possible solutions, and test the solutions that you think might work well.

It may be easier to reach for unhealthier comfort foods and snacks while you spend more time at home, but try to keep a balanced approach. When you stock up on groceries, don‚Äôt ignore fresh fruit and vegetables‚Äîwe still have everything we need to prepare food. Now that we're advised to limit the amount of time we spend in public spaces like grocery stores, this is a great time to try out new fruits and vegetables that keep at home for longer periods of time. If it's safer for you to stay home or you are in self-isolation, reach out for help. Many grocery stores and meal prep services offer safe, no-contact delivery. You can also ask family or friends to bring you groceries, or look for local COVID-19 support groups on social media. It's safest if others leave food and other supplies outside of your door to avoid spreading the virus. Exercise is an important part of mental health and well-being, stress management, and health sleep. However, it's something that many people give up when they start to feel stressed or overwhelmed. If it's safe for you to do so, spend time outside. You should still avoid busy areas or groups and stay at least two metres away from others, but there is no reason to avoid walks, runs, or other safe outdoor activities. (Note that some municipalities, BC Parks, and Parks Canada have restricted some outdoor spaces to reduce crowds, so check the status of your local parks or trails and respect closures‚Äîthey're just keeping everyone safe.) If you prefer to exercise indoors, you can also find many different exercises classes online. You can try yoga, follow a barre class, work on your cardio, pick up a new dumbbell routine, and keep up with Crossfit WODs from the comfort of your living room. Look for no-equipment exercise routines or classes if you don't already have equipment. Poor sleep can make even simple problems feel a lot worse than they really are. Poor sleep can affect your mood, your outlook, and your patience. Unfortunately, stress and anxiety can really take a toll on your sleep. If you're having a hard time sleeping, be proactive and practice healthy sleep habits.

If you don't have a lot of energy or focus right now, try low-effort distractions like watching TV, browsing Youtube, listening to a podcast or audiobook, playing a game on your phone, reading an easy book or magazine, or working on a simple art project. If you have more energy and focus, give yourself a to-do list every day: you can clean and take care of projects around your home, work on hobbies, connect with family or friends, read a new book and catch up on your favourite TV shows. You can find interesting opportunities to take online courses from universities all over the world through MOOCs and other online learning platforms, you can learn a new language online or through apps, and you can learn new hobbies and activities. As more people have to practice social distancing or self-isolation, people are finding creative ways to bring the world into their homes: you can tour museums and art galleries, Skype with a scientist, watch animals at zoos and nature preserves, and more. When normal schedules are disrupted, it's easy to fall into unhelpful habits. Look for ways to keep yourself on track with healthier habits. You could set yourself goals every day or turn activities into a fun competition with friends or family‚Äîwhoever takes the most language classes wins! Many communities are using social media platforms like Facebook to organize support and help for neighbours. If you are healthy and it's safe to do so, you can sign up to walk dogs, pick up groceries and household supplies, and help others who can't go out at the moment.

When we feel stressed out, angry, or fearful, it's hard to look at the situation realistically and see all of the options we have. (Remember: we all control our own actions and reactions, no matter what's going on in the world. We can all do something about this pandemic.) People often overestimate the negative parts‚Äîtheir own feelings, their own abilities to manage a difficult situation, or the situation itself‚Äîand underestimate positive parts‚Äîtheir own abilities to care for themselves and loved ones, their support networks, and opportunities. How does the thought 'We're never going to make it through this!' make you feel? It likely doesn't feel good‚Äîand it isn't even true. Challenging negative, unhelpful thoughts can improve your mood, validate your ability to get through this, and help you see new options or opportunities to stay well. Stop and notice thoughts that come up. How do they make you feel? Do your thoughts seem realistic if you look at the situation more objectively? How can you reframe the thought to make it more productive or hopeful? Can you find any positive aspects or think of new ways to approach the situation? Here are a few examples: 'I'm so mad that my event was canceled! This sucks!' 'I know this is the safer option for everyone. When it's rescheduled, I'll enjoy it more because I won't have to worry about getting sick or spreading the illness.' 'I hate spending so much time at home. This is so boring.' 'I'm doing my part to keep my neighbors safe. It's worth it because it keeps people healthy.' 'I'm having a hard time getting used to my new schedule. This is so frustrating.' 'I'll get used to this soon, just like I adapted the last time I had to change my schedule. Now that I'm home more, I'll have more time to finish the projects I haven't touched in months and I'm excited to see the end results.' 'I'm really scared and I don't know what to do. I feel so overwhelmed right now.' 'It makes sense that I feel scared‚Äîpeople are getting sick and we don't know when things will go back to normal. But there are a lot of things I can do to keep healthy, and I'm going to do some research so I can do my best. When I focus on the things I can do, everything feels more manageable.' 'We're going to be stuck inside forever. I'm already sick of this.' 'I understand that it will take some time to manage COVID-19, and I trust that health care professionals and scientists are working as fast as they can. I know this will end eventually and life will go back to normal.' The goal is not to ignore the bad or uncomfortable parts of the situation or deny that there's a problem. Instead, this exercise can help you understand the situation more realistically and see the parts that you can control right now."

These automatic thoughts and assumptions are sometimes called thinking traps. Everyone falls into unbalanced thinking traps from time to time. You're most likely to distort your interpretation of things when you already feel sad, angry, anxious, depressed or stressed. You're also more vulnerable to thinking traps when you're not taking good care of yourself, like when you're not eating or sleeping well. Here are some common thinking traps: Thinking that a negative situation is part of a constant cycle of bad things that happen. People who overgeneralize often use words like 'always' or 'never.' I was really looking forward to that concert, and now it‚Äôs cancelled. This always happens to me! I never get to do fun things! Seeing things as only right or wrong, good or bad, perfect or terrible. People who think in black and white terms see a small mistake as a total failure. I wanted to eat healthier, but I ate too many snacks today. This plan is a total failure! Saying only negative things about yourself or other people. I made a mistake. I'm stupid! My boss told me that I made a mistake. My boss is a total jerk! Predicting that something bad will happen without any evidence. I've been doing what I can to stay home and reduce the risks, but I just know that I'm going to get sick. Focusing only on the negative parts of a situation and ignoring anything good or positive. I know there's a lot I can do at home, but I'm just so sick of this. Everything is terrible. Believing that bad feelings or emotions reflect the situation. I feel scared and overwhelmed right now, so that must mean everything is very bad and will never get better. Telling yourself how you 'should' or 'must' act. I should be able to handle this without getting upset and crying! Here are helpful strategies to challenge common thinking traps. Many people find their mood and confidence improve after working through these skills. You can also find worksheets to help you go through each step at www.heretohelp.bc.ca. Don't try to get out of a thinking trap by just telling yourself to stop thinking that way. This doesn't let you look at the evidence and challenge the thinking trap. When you try and push upsetting thoughts away, they are more likely to keep popping back into your mind. Ask yourself the following questions when something upsetting happens: What is the situation? What actually happened? Only include facts that everyone would agree on. What are your thoughts? What are you telling yourself? What are your emotions? How do you feel? What are your behaviours? How are you reacting? What are you doing to cope? Take a look at the thoughts you've listed. Are you using any of the thinking traps and falling into distorted thinking patterns? It's common to fall into more than one thinking trap. Go back to the thinking trap list and identify which ones apply to you and your current situation. The best way to break a thinking trap is to look at your thoughts like a scientist and consider the hard facts. Use the evidence you've collected to challenge your thinking traps. Here are some ways to do that:Try to find evidence against the thought. If you make a mistake at work, you might automatically think, 'I can't do anything right! I must be a terrible employee!'' When this thought comes up, you might challenge it by asking, Is there any evidence to support this thought? Is there any evidence to disprove this thought? You might quickly realize that your boss has complimented your work recently, which doesn't support the idea that you're a bad employee. Ask yourself, 'Would I judge other people if they did the same thing? Am I being harder on myself than I am on other people? This is a great method for challenging thinking traps that involve harsh self-criticism. Find out whether other people you trust agree with your thoughts. For example, you might have trouble with one of your kids and think, 'Good parents wouldn't have this kind of problem.' To challenge this thought, you can ask other parents if they've ever had any problems with their kids. Test your beliefs in person. For example, if you think that your friends don't care about you, call a few friends and make plans to start a regular video call. If you assumed that they will all say no, you may be pleasantly surprised to hear that they do want to see you. Once you have worked through some challenges, try to think of a more balanced thought to replace the old thinking traps. Let's use the following example: I feel sad and overwhelmed. I'm having a hard time figuring out what to do. I'm the worst! I should be able to handle this! Labeling 'Should' statements Examine the evidence: I have a lot of challenges right now. I'm worried about my family and everything seems to change so quickly. I've successfully handled complicated situations in the past, so I know I can do this. It's okay to feel upset right now‚Äîthere's a lot going on. I'm going to think about how I got through past situations and see what worked for me. I'm trying to do a lot on my own, so I'm going to talk to my family so we can make a plan and work together.

  - text: "While a lot of people think of grief in terms of losing a person or pet, grief can come up whenever you lose something important. This includes: Losing security, like losing your job or wondering how long you'll be able to pay rent Losing stability or routine, like finding yourself working from home or navigating childcare closures Losing your sense of safety, like fearing you or someone you love might end up with COVID-19 Losing your social relationships, like missing time with family and friends now that everyone must practice physical distancing or self-isolation Losing hope for the future, like feeling that life will never go back to normal Losing important goals, like finding your classes, sports competitions, or performances are cancelled for the foreseeable future Losing important milestone celebrations like graduation ceremonies and weddings Grief bring up complicated feelings. You might feel sad, angry, frustrated, fearful, or hopeless. You may have a hard time eating or sleeping, or feel very tense. You may feel overwhelmed and tired. You may wonder if life will ever feel normal again. Everyone grieves in their own way and their own time. Here are some strategies to try as you navigate your own journey. Acknowledge and express your feelings in a healthy way. Give your feelings a name and find healthy ways to express them, such as by talking with a friend, writing in a journal, or making art. Give yourself as much time as you need. Grief follows its own schedule. Give yourself permission to use this time to take care of your well-being. Let go of expectations, tasks, or other obligations that can wait. Seek support. Grief can feel very isolating, even though a lot of people are experiencing some sort of loss right now. Reach out to friends or family and share your feelings. Look for ways to help and support each other. Take care of yourself. Ignoring health and well-being can make difficult experiences feel worse. Eat as well as you can, try to get enough sleep, spend time outside if it's safe for you to do so, and exercise regularly. Think about self-care activities or strategies that have helped you cope with challenging situations in the past and make time for those activities. Know that feelings of grief will pass. Grief may feel intense at times, but those feelings will become more manageable over time and will eventually pass. Connect with a mental health professional if you're having a hard time. If you're having a hard time getting through the day, coping in unhealthy ways, or having a hard time managing difficult thoughts or feelings, it's a good idea to seek help from a professional like a psychologist or counsellor‚Äîmany now offer online or phone appointments.
